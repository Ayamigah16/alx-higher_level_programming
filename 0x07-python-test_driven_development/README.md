# Project: Python Test-driven Development
This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python. Test-driven development is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It helps ensure that the code is reliable, maintainable, and meets the desired requirements.

In this project, we will be working on various Python scripts and writing corresponding test cases using the **`doctest`** module. The project covers the following tasks:

1. ***Integers Addition:*** Implement a function that adds two integers.

2. ***Divide a Matrix:*** Create a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

3. ***Say My Name:*** Write a function that prints a person's name.

4. ***Print Square:*** Develop a function that prints a square using the '#' character.

5. ***Text Indentation:*** Implement a function that adds two new lines after specific characters in a text.

6. ***Max Integer - Unittest:*** Write unittests for a function that finds the maximum integer in a list.

7. ***Matrix Multiplication:*** Multiply two matrices using the numpy module.

10. ***CPython #3:*** Python Strings: Create a function in C that prints Python strings.

Each task has its own requirements, test cases, and specifications, which need to be carefully followed to ensure successful completion.

## Getting Started
To run the scripts and test cases, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.8.5 or later installed.
3. Install the required dependencies, if any, mentioned in the project's specific tasks.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run the desired Python scripts using the command python3 script_name.py.
5. To run the test cases, use the command python3 -m doctest -v tests/test_file.txt.
