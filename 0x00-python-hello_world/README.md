# Project README

This project contains various Python and C scripts that demonstrate different concepts in programming. Each script focuses on a specific task and provides a solution to accomplish that task. Below, you will find a description of each task along with the corresponding file names, instructions, and sample outputs.



## Task 0: Run Python file

### File: 0-run

This task involves writing a shell script that runs a Python script. The Python script file name is saved in the environment variable **$PYFILE**. The shell script executes the Python script and prints the output.



### Instructions:

1. Set the environment variable **$PYFILE** to the name of the Python file you want to execute.

2. Run the shell script **0-run**.

3. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 1: Run inline

### File: 1-run_inline

In this task, you need to write a shell script that runs Python code. The Python code is saved in the environment variable $PYCODE. The shell script executes the Python code and prints the output.



### Instructions:

1. Set the environment variable **$PYCODE** to the desired Python code.

2. Run the shell script **1-run_inline**.

3. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 2: Hello, print

### File: 2-print.py

The goal of this task is to write a Python script that prints the following line: "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script **2-print.py**.

2. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 3: Print integer

### File: 3-print_number.py

In this task, you need to complete the provided Python script to print an integer stored in the variable number, followed by the text "Battery street", and a new line. You should not convert the variable number into a string.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script **3-print_number.py**.

2. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 4: Print float

### File: 4-print_float.py

The task involves completing the provided Python script to print a float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script 4-print_float.py.

2. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 5: Print string

### File: 5-print_string.py

In this task, you need to complete the provided Python script to print a string stored in the variable str three times, followed by a new line, and then print the first 9 characters of the string on a new line.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script 5-print_string.py.

2. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 6: Play with strings

### File: 6-concat.py

The objective of this task is to print the string "Welcome to Holberton School!" using only the provided variables str1 and str2 in a new line of code. You cannot use any loops or conditional statements.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script  **6-concat.py**.

2. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 7: Copy - Cut - Paste

### File: 7-edges.py

The ojective of this task is to manipulate a given string and extract specific parts.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script  **7-edges.py**.

2. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 8: Create a New Sentence

###  File: 8-concat_edges.py

The objective of this task is to concatenate parts of a given string and print a new sentence.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script  **8-concat_edges.py**.

2. The output will be printed to the console.



## Task 9: Easter Egg

### File: 9-easter_egg.py

The objective of this task is write a python script to print *"The Zen of Python"* by Tim Peters.



### Instructions:

1. Run the Python script  **9-easter_egg.py**.

2. The output will be printed to the console.


## Task 10: Linked List Cycle
